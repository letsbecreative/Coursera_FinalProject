        <h2 class="food_name">Pizza</h2>
        <img src="images/pizza.jpg" alt="sj">
        <p>Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
          <br><strong>Where:</strong> No. 3, Saniara Apartments, Opposite Nagarvala School, Central Avenue, Kalyani Nagar</p>

                <img src="images/dessert.jpg" alt="sj" style="float:left">

        <p>Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course usually consists of sweet foods, such as confections, and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine or liqueur; however, in the United States it may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items regarded as a separate course elsewhere.

                <img src="images/poha.jpg" alt="sj">

        <p>A hole in the wall that needs no introduction, Bipin Snacks has been standing humbly on Karve road for more than five decades. It is Pune’s famed joint for some wholesome breakfast. The places serves hands down one of the best pohe in the city - if you haven’t had it yet, may the force be with you! Soft, fluffy, and steamed pohe garnished with sev, with fried onions peeping in from hither and thither.The coconut shreds thrown over the dish make it magical to taste!

        <h2 class="food_name">Misal Pav</h2>
        <img src="images/misalpav1.jpg" alt="sj">
        <p>Misal is prepared in part with sprouted lentils and has less water content and a watery, spicy "cut" or "bite". It has two parts, a thick curry of matki, called usal, and watery gravy, also called rassa. Usually people mix these two according to their taste and requirement.vIt may be garnished with Indian snack noodles. The moth curry or usal form is prepared using onion, ginger, garlic and other spices.

        <img src="images/panipuri.jpg" alt="sj">
        <p>The Pani Puri here is different, and unlike many places, they serve it with ragda instead of the regular potato mix. The ragda mix is hot and the chutneys added are cold. So, if you like the Ragda Pani Puri, this is the best place you can think of. There are many other teenie-meenie thelas across the city, but no one does it like them. The Sev Puri and Dry Masala Puri are also some nice additions to the newly changed menu lately.<br>

        <img src="images/bunmaska.jpg" alt="sj">
        <p>Love it or hate it, you can’t ignore this legendary spot. We personally like the Irani Chai here. A little too sweet compared to Café Yezdan’s but the flavour is spot-on. The Bun Maska with raspberry and mixed fruit jams pair well with the chai. Of course, the omelette and other things are good, but if you are looking for a quick and reasonably priced bite, go for the chai and bun maska.<br>
